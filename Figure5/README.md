# Network Files
All network .mat files are labeled with the share of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the network.
For example, E60_I40 indicates a network with 60% Exc. neurons, 40% Inh. neurons. Network files contain the conectivity and spiking  
behavior of all of the neurons in the network.

# Data for Direct Figure Generation
DataForFigure5.mat and Figure5Code.m contain the data used to make the panels for Figure 5.
